A [Catalyst](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst) is a Server that bundles different Services required by the Decentraland World. Some of the main responsibilities of the server are the management of the decentralized storage for most of the content needed by the client and the orchestration of communications between peers.

If you just want to run a [Catalyst](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst) Server, please check the [Catalyst Owner](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-owner) repository and more step by step information can be found in the [tutorials section](https://tech-docs.decentraland.org/contributor/tutorials/how-to-run-a-catalyst) of the [Technical Documentation](https://tech-docs.decentraland.org/contributor) site. 

In case you would like to know more about the components that make Decentraland work, check out the [Architecture](https://github.com/decentraland/architecture) repository.
